# Model Context Protocol (MCP)  üöÄ

This path is designed to help students learn how to build modern AI applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) and connect them to real-world tools and data using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

---

## 1. Programming, LLM & API Basics üßë‚Äçüíª

Before jumping into MCP, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic programming (any language: Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
- Using APIs (sending/receiving data, working with JSON)
- Understanding how web apps and tools communicate

### Learn Programming
- [Codecademy: Learn to Code](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)
- [FreeCodeCamp: APIs and Microservices](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/)

## 2. Large Language Models (LLMs) & LLM App Development üß†

MCP is most powerful when used with LLMs! Get familiar with:

### What are LLMs?
- Large Language Models (like GPT, Claude, Llama) can understand and generate text.
- They work by predicting the next word in a sentence, using huge datasets and neural networks.

### Building LLM-based Applications
- Use APIs from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Hugging Face to build chatbots, summarizers, and more.
- Try frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex to add tools and retrieval to your LLM apps.
- Learn the basics of prompt engineering‚Äîhow to ask your LLM the right questions.

## 3. First Principles: Protocols & Interoperability üåê

MCP builds on concepts from other protocols. Understanding these helps you see why MCP is needed.

- **REST APIs:** How web apps talk to each other using HTTP and JSON.
- **JSON-RPC:** A protocol for sending requests and responses as JSON.
- **Language Server Protocol (LSP):** Standardizes how editors and tools communicate‚ÄîMCP is inspired by this!

**Explore:**
- [RESTful API Tutorial](https://restfulapi.net/)
- [JSON-RPC 2.0 Spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
- [LSP Spec (Microsoft)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/)

## 4. What is MCP? ü§î

**MCP is an open protocol that makes it easy for LLM-based apps to securely access tools, files, databases, and more‚Äîno custom integration needed!**  
Think of it as USB-C for AI: plug-and-play for any tool or data source.

**Why MCP?**
- No more one-off connectors for every new tool.
- Secure, standardized, and open.
- Works with any language model or AI agent.

**How does it work?**
- **Host:** The main AI app (like Claude Desktop, a chatbot, or an IDE).
- **Client:** Connects the host to a single MCP server.
- **Server:** Exposes tools, data, or prompts to the client.

## 5. MCP Architecture & Core Concepts üß©

- **Resources:** Data the AI can access (files, databases, APIs).
- **Tools:** Functions the AI can use (search, update, automate).
- **Prompts:** Templates to help AI interact with tools or resources.
- **Transport:** Works locally (stdin/stdout) or over the web (HTTP/SSE).
- **JSON-RPC:** All communication uses this simple, standard message format.

## 6. Why Use MCP for LLM Apps? üåü

- **Standardization:** Build once, connect to many tools and data sources.
- **Flexibility:** Switch between different AI models or vendors easily.
- **Security:** You control what data and tools the AI can access.
- **Scalability:** Supports many connections and grows with your needs.

---

## 7. Hands-on: Explore & Build with MCP üõ†Ô∏è

- **Try real MCP servers and clients:** See how they connect to GitHub, Google Drive, databases, and more.
- **Use MCP Inspector:** Like Postman for MCP‚Äîtest and debug integrations.
- **Build your own MCP server:** Start simple‚Äîexpose a file or tool to an AI assistant.

### Example Projects
- Turn a GitHub repo into a documentation hub for AI.
- Control Spotify or Docker with natural language.
- Let AI search and summarize your notes.

## 8. Security, Consent, and Privacy üîí

- **User consent:** You must approve what data and tools the AI can access.
- **Privacy:** Data stays in your system unless you allow access.
- **Tool safety:** The AI can only use tools you approve, and you can see what it‚Äôs doing.

**Best practices:**
- Always review and approve what your AI can access or do.
- Use clear UIs for permissions and logs.
